            <h1>Hugo Ballard´s Site</h1>
                        <p>Heyyyyy, I am Hugo Ballard. I survived the Hindenburg disaster and found a spy on the ship who was almost killed. Then I jumped off the ship and got injured. Before this, me and my sister went to Africa for their father to research lions, but his sister got malaria and almost died. They went to Germany to see a malaria doctor but the doctor did nothing. He reccomennded they go to New York to see the best malaria doctor in the world, so they took the Hindenburg.</p>
